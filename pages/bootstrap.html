        <div id="ans1" class="collapse p-2"> Bootstrap is a very useful tool for developing responsive web pages, which
            allows sites to look good and work correctly on different devices and screens. In addition, it offers a wide
            variety of tools and components so that developers can create attractive and functional websites with greater
            speed, ease and efficiency.

                <dt>Responsive design</dt>
                <dd>The main goal of Bootstrap is to build responsive websites for mobile devices. In a very simple and
                    organized way, it allows you to design pages specially adapted to work on smartphones, tablets and
                    desktops.</dd>

            3. Advantages and disadvantages of Bootstrap
        </button>
        <div id="ans3" class="collapse p-2">
            <h5>Advantages</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Easy to use and saves time</b> - It allows you to design a website using different combinations of
                    HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, and integrates with
                    JavaScript libraries. It comes with ready-made styles and templates. It comes with complete
                    documentation that makes it easy to use. </li>
                <li><b>Responsive</b> - Its templates are easily customizable and responsive. It includes a useful grid
                    system for layout by columns that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Compatibility</b> - Changing versions can be difficult if deep modifications have been made. It is
                    recommended to work with Bootstrap from the beginning of the project to avoid compatibility issues. It
                    is not a lightweight framework and some functionality requires the use of JavaScript and jQuery.</li>
                <li><b>Layout constraints</b> - The layout needs to be adapted to a 12-column grid system, which may require
                    specific changes to Bootstrap's default styles.</li>
                <li><b>Can be heavy</b> - The files generated by Bootstrap and end results can be quite heavy and result in
                    slower loading times, as well as battery drain issues. </li>
                <li><b>Unoriginal design </b> - Without a lot of modification, everything built with Bootstrap will have a
                    very similar look. </li>
            </ul>

            4. How to use Bootstrap in a project
        </button>
        <div id="ans4" class="collapse p-2">
            Bootstrap can be easily installed by visiting <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">the official page</a> and
            downloading the package files. The installation files include CSS style sheets, JavaScript files, and fonts, and
            can be adapted to any type of web project. To work with Bootstrap, simply add the style sheets and the
            JavaScript file in the header or before the closing tag of the HTML file.
            Alternatively, it can be used using Bootstrap CDN links that can be included in the project for free.
        </div>

        <button class="btn btn-info text-black p-2 m-2" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#ans5">
            5. Responsive design with Bootstrap
        </button>
        <div id="ans5" class="collapse p-2">
            Sites built with Bootstrap will automatically adjust to the size of the screen they are viewed on. This is
            possible thanks to the inclusion of the Bootstrap <strong>Grid system. </strong><br>
            The grid system divides the screen into <strong>twelve virtual columns</strong> and allows developers to specify
            how elements should be displayed on each screen size. For example, on a small screen, certain elements can be
            specified to stack vertically to make them easier to read and navigate on mobile devices. <br>
            To implement a responsive layout in Bootstrap, you can use the column size classes, such as <i>col-sm </i>for
            small screens, <i>col-md </i>for medium screens, and <i>col-lg</i> for large screens. These classes can be
            applied to any HTML element, such as a div or an image, to define how it will display on different screen
            sizes.<br>
    
            For example, an element can be specified to have a width of 12 columns (full width of screen) on mobile devices,
            but only 3 or 4 columns on computer screens.

            6. Components in Bootstrap
        </button>
        <div id="ans6" class="collapse p-2">
            Bootstrap offers a large number of prebuilt components that web developers can use in their projects. These
            components include navigation menus, carousels, pricing tables, and many others. On its official page, Bootstrap
            offers examples of these components, which makes it easy to implement. Some of the most used components are:
            <ul>
                <li>carousel</li>
                <li>navbar and navs</li>
                <li>jumbotron</li>
                <li>breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>pagination</li>
                <li>tooltips</li>
                <li>forms</li>
                <li>cards</li>
            </ul>
    
            For instance, a navbar and nav components allow you to create a responsive navigation bar with different
            elements such as links and dropdowns. The navbar elements are created using HTML lists and styled with
            Bootstrap-specific classes. Bootstrap's inbuilt JavaScript can be used to activate the dropdown functionality in
            the navigation bar.

            7. Types of Bootstrap layout
        </button>
        <div id="ans7" class="collapse p-2">
            There are two major layouts for Bootstrap:
            <dl>
                <dt>Fixed Layout</dt>
                <dd>This uses the bootstrap .container class for the layout. The fixed-layout has specific pixel width
                    values that change with the help of media queries, which makes the site responsive. Fixed layout resizes
                    at intervals following the specified pixel values.
                </dd>
                <dt>Fluid Layout</dt>
                <dd>This uses the bootstrap .container-fluid class for the layout. This layout uses proportional values such
                    as percentages for blocks of content, images, or any other item. Fluid layout continuously resizes as
                    you change the width of your browser by any amount, leaving no extra empty space on the sides. Hence it
                    is named “fluid layout”.
                    </dt>
            </dl>
    
            <b>Containers</b> are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid
            system. Bootstrap comes with three different containers.<br>
            Fixed layout containers:
            <ul>
                <li><i>.container</i>, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</li>
                <li><i>.container-{breakpoint}</i>, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint. The breakpoint can
                    be
                    (sm/md/lg/xl). See <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/overview/">here</a> for details.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Fluid layout container:
            <ul>
                <li><i>.container-fluid</i>, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</li>
            </ul>

        </button>
        <div id="ans8" class="collapse p-2">
            Bootstrap includes predefined button styles, each with its own style and/or semantic purpose:
            <ul>
                <li><button class="btn btn-primary">Primary </button> Provides more visual weight to a button while
                    representing a primary action for visitors to take on the page. E.g. homepage.</li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-secondary"> Secondary</button> Provides more visual weight to a button while
                    representing a secondary action for visitors to take on the page. E.g. demo </li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-success">Success </button>Indicates a successful or positive action. E.g. at the
                    completion of a form.</li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-danger"> Danger</button> A potentially dangerous action. E.g. to ensure visitors
                    review their information before submitting.</li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-warning">Warning </button> Represents a warning. For example, the warning button
                    can indicate that some required form fields were missed </li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-info"> Info </button> An informational alert. For example, on an account
                    registration form, an info button might indicate that a user can click to edit their profile.</li>
                <li><button class="btn btn-light"> Light </button> A great option for web pages with dark background colors
                </li>
